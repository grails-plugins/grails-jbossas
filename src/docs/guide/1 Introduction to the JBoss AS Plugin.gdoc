The JBoss AS plugin helps to deploy Grails applications to the JBoss application server. Each version of JBoss has various issues that must be managed and they change from version to version, and even the issues that are consistent across versions have different fixes for each major version of JBoss. So this plugin contains scripts that generate various deployment descriptors, as well as functionality to delete problematic jar files and tweak the Hibernate configuration as needed.

As of this writing, only JBoss 5 and 6 are supported. There are various open bugs in JBoss 7.0 ([AS7-1551|https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-1551], [AS7-1601|https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-1601]) and 7.1 ([AS7-2941|https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-2941]) that prevent even trivial Grails applications from deploying. Once there is a viable version of JBoss 7 that works with Grails the plugin will be updated with whatever new and interesting --hacks-- fixes are needed to enable deployment.
